Bayesian VAR toolbox for Inference, Prediction and Causality

by F. Ferroni and F. Canova

The Bayesian VAR toolbox is a new package that includes MATLAB functions to estimate VAR models with Bayesian methods. The toolbox allows to conduct inference under various prior assumptions, to produce point and density forecasts and to trace the causal effect of shocks using a number of identification schemes. The toolbox is also equipped to handle missing observations. A tutorial and examples are provided
